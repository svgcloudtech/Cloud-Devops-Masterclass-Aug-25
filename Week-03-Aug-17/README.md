# Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is a technology that allows you to store and access data and applications over the internet instead of using your computerâ€™s hard drive or a local server.

- **On-Demand Access:** Users can access services/resources instantly, scaling up or down.  
- **Infrastructure:** Depends on remote servers managed by CSPs.  
- **Benefits:** Cost saving, scalability, reliability, and accessibility.  

**Examples of data stored:** files, images, videos, documents.

---

# What is cloud architecture?
Cloud architecture defines the **front end, back end, networking, and delivery models** that combine to run applications.

- **Purpose:** Design strategy for connecting cloud infrastructure to meet business workloads & costs.  
- **Vendors:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, VMware.  
- **Business Value:** Lower infra costs, high scalability, faster innovation.  

ðŸ‘‰ McKinsey predicts cloud could generate **USD 3 trillion EBITDA by 2030**.

---

## Cloud architecture best practices
- Automate operations (cost, reliability, security).  
- Respect data gravity (move compute to data).  
- Choose best platform per workload.  

---

## The benefits of cloud architecture
- **Custom migration strategies** (migrate DBs/apps).  
- **Accelerate modernization** (Kubernetes, self-service).  
- **Speed time-to-market** (Agile + DevOps).  
- **Innovation** (AI, ML, Quantum, Blockchain, IoT).  
- **Resiliency** (DR, uptime).  
- **Compliance & Security** (encryption, regulations).  

---

## Cloud architecture components
1. **Front-end** â€“ GUIs, dashboards, client apps.  
2. **Back-end** â€“ servers, storage, APIs, middleware, security tools.  
3. **Network** â€“ internet, intranet, CDNs, SDN, load balancers.  
4. **Delivery models** â€“ IaaS, PaaS, SaaS (and FaaS, BPaaS, Serverless).  

---

## Key cloud architecture technologies
- **Virtualization** â†’ abstraction into VMs, containers.  
- **Automation** â†’ CI/CD, provisioning, scaling.  

---

## Cloud deployment models
- **Public Cloud** â†’ AWS, Azure, GCP.  
- **Private Cloud** â†’ dedicated for one org.  
- **Hybrid Cloud** â†’ mix of public/private/on-prem.  
- **Hybrid Multicloud** â†’ multi-provider flexibility.  

---

# What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the **worldâ€™s most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform**.  
It provides compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, ML, AI, IoT, and more.

---

# Why Choose AWS?
- **Comprehensive Service Portfolio** â†’ 200+ services.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility** â†’ elastic resources.  
- **Cost-Effective** â†’ pay-as-you-go pricing.  
- **Global Reach** â†’ 37 regions, 99+ availability zones.  
- **Robust Security** â†’ encryption, compliance, IAM.  

---

## AWS Cloud Overview
- Intro to AWS Global Infrastructure.  
- **37 Regions, 99+ AZs, 600+ Edge Locations.**  
- Local Zones & Wavelength Zones (low latency).  
- Used by startups, enterprises, governments.  

---

## IAM Users, Roles & Policies
- **Users:** Identities with credentials.  
- **Groups:** Shared policies for users.  
- **Roles:** Temporary access (cross-account, federated, **Roles Anywhere**).  
- **Policies:** JSON docs for allow/deny.  
- **Best Practices:** Least privilege, MFA, rotate keys.  

---

## S3 Buckets: Create, Upload, Manage
- **Durability:** 11 nines.  
- **Storage Classes:** Standard, IA, Glacier, **Express One Zone (new)**.  
- **Demo:** Create bucket, upload file, enable encryption.  
- **Management:** Organize with prefixes, event notifications.  

---

## S3 Versioning & Lifecycle Rules
- **Versioning:** Multiple object versions, restore deleted files.  
- **Lifecycle Rules:** Transition to Glacier, delete old versions.  
- **Demo:** Archive objects after 30 days.  
- **Outcome:** Cost optimization + data protection.
