### Step 2: Specify User Details
1. Enter the **User Name** (e.g., `test1111`).  
   - Usernames can be up to 64 characters.  
   - Valid characters: `A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`, `+`, `=`, `,`, `.`, `@`, `_`, `-`  

2. Check **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console** for console login.  
3. Select **Autogenerated password** (recommended for security).  
4. Select **Require password reset** at first login (Best practice).  
5. Click **Next**.

### Step 3: Set Permissions
1. Choose **Attach Policies Directly** (for demo).  
   - Best practice: Add to a **Group**.  

2. Select the following policies:  
   - **AdministratorAccess**  
   - **IAMUserChangePassword** (so the user can change their password).  

3. Click **Next**.  

---

### Step 4: Review and Create
1. Review user details and permissions.  
2. Confirm policies → `AdministratorAccess` + `IAMUserChangePassword`.  
3. Click on **Create User**.

### Step 5: Retrieve Credentials
1. Once created, you’ll see the **user credentials** page.  
2. Download the `.csv` file → It contains **username, password, and login URL**.  
3. Share securely with the user.  

⚠️ **Never share credentials over email/chat in plain text.** Use secure channels.

## 🧑‍🏫 Trainer Notes (How to Explain in Class)

- **Introduction Dialogue**:  
  *“IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows us to securely manage access to AWS resources. Instead of using the root account, we create users with controlled access.”*

- **When entering User Name**:  
  *“Here we give the user an identity. Think of this as giving an employee an ID badge in the office.”*

- **When selecting Console Access**:  
  *“If the user needs to login to AWS Console via browser, we check this option. Otherwise, for developers using CLI, we provide programmatic access.”*

- **When attaching policies**:  
  *“Policies are like job roles. An Admin policy gives full rights, but in production we follow the principle of least privilege.”*

- **When clicking Create**:  
  *“Now AWS generates the credentials. Always save the CSV and hand it to the user securely.”*

## 🛠 Demo Guide for Trainers

1. Open AWS Console → IAM → Users.  
2. Create a demo user `student-demo`.  
3. Assign **AdministratorAccess** for hands-on session.  
4. Ask students to login with the credentials.  
5. After demo, **delete the user** to avoid security risks.
